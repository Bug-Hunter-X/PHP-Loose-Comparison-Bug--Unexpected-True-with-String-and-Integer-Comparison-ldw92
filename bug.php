This code suffers from a subtle bug related to PHP's type juggling and the behavior of the `==` operator.  The function `checkValue` intends to determine if a user input is equal to '1' but it has a flaw. If the user inputs a non-numeric string like 'true', 'false', or any other string, the comparison `$userInput == 1`  might unexpectedly return true due to PHP's loose comparison.
